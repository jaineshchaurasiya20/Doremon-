# Doremon-
this is a personal HTML and CSS project where I recreated Doraemon to explore the depths of my understanding in CSS styling and animation. By building each part modularly, I challenged myself to think creatively and test how deeply I could apply visual logic and interactivity using pure code.

# ðŸŽ¨ Doraemon in Pure CSS
A creative front-end experiment built using HTML and CSS to recreate the iconic character Doraemon with detailed styling and animation. This project pushes the boundaries of what can be accomplished using pure CSS â€” no SVGs, no canvas, just code and curiosity.

## ðŸš€ Why This Project
This project was designed as a personal challenge to:
- Deepen my understanding of CSS positioning, layering, and animation
- Explore the logic behind visual styling without relying on external assets
- Test how creatively I could think through modular design and animation

## âœ¨ Features
- **Modular structure**: Each component (eyes, smile, bell, etc.) built and styled independently
- **Smooth animations**: Subtle motions and transitions using `@keyframes`
- **Pixel-perfect detailing**: Focus on proportions and layering to match the cartoon
- **Responsive layout**: Designed to adapt across various screen sizes

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
  - Flexbox
  - Keyframe animations
  - Z-index manipulation
  - Gradients and shape styling
  - 
## ðŸ§  Lessons Learned
- CSS can be extremely powerful when combined with a strong visual mindset
- Layering and positioning require both planning and trial-and-error
- Animation timing can dramatically improve the feel of a static design
